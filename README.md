# openloop

A beat-based looper coded in overtone/clojure.

Based on the Synchronous Looping Environment by Eli Fieldsteel, written in SuperCollider.

Based on a master/slave loop paradigm, loop data (number of bars, length in seconds, location of downbeats, etc) is passed between Synths in order to maintain synchronicity. Limited only by memory and CPU.

The original SuperCollider code is [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/233190/looping_environment_YT_2011-07-11_COMMENTS.rtf), in rtf format.
I've converted it to normal text [here](https://github.com/magnetophon/openloop/blob/master/doc/looping_environment_Eli_Fieldsteel.sc).

## Usage

Better not use it yet, unless you want to help develop it.
WIP!
